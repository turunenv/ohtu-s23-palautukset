There are many different ways to carry out a retrospective. The Start, Stop, Continue, More of Less of Wheel
retrospective method encourages the project team to openly give feedback on all the categories mentioned
in the method name - e.g. "what should we do more of?" or "what is getting in our way?". The method only requires 
a marker and a flip chart paper, and can be carried out in 10-25 minutes.

In the Glad, Sad, Mad -method the team members write down observations made regarding the previous sprint, which
will then be categorized as either Glad, Sad or Mad. The participants then take a vote on which issues they want 
discussed. The method is fairly simple and allows tackling a wide variety of issues.
